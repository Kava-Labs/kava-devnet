# Building your app

## `Makefile`

Help users build your application by writing a `./Makefile` in the root directory that includes common commands:

> _*NOTE*_: The below Makefile contains some of same commands as the Cosmos SDK and Tendermint Makefiles.

```make
DEP := $(shell command -v dep 2> /dev/null)

get_tools:
ifndef DEP
	@echo "Installing dep"
	go get -u -v github.com/golang/dep/cmd/dep
else
	@echo "Dep is already installed..."
endif

get_vendor_deps:
	@echo "--> Generating vendor directory via dep ensure"
	@rm -rf .vendor-new
	@dep ensure -v -vendor-only

update_vendor_deps:
	@echo "--> Running dep ensure"
	@rm -rf .vendor-new
	@dep ensure -v -update

install:
	go install ./cmd/nsd
	go install ./cmd/nscli
```

## `Gopkg.toml`

Golang has a few dependency management tools. In this tutorial you will be using [`dep`](https://golang.github.io/dep/). `dep` uses a `Gopkg.toml` file in the root of the repository to define what dependencies the application needs. Cosmos SDK apps currently depend on specific versions of some libraries. The below manifest contains all the necessary versions. To get started replace the contents of the `./Gopkg.toml` file with the `constraints` and `overrides` below:

```toml
# Gopkg.toml example
#
# Refer to https://golang.github.io/dep/docs/Gopkg.toml.html
# for detailed Gopkg.toml documentation.
#
# required = ["github.com/user/thing/cmd/thing"]
# ignored = ["github.com/user/project/pkgX", "bitbucket.org/user/project/pkgA/pkgY"]
#
# [[constraint]]
#   name = "github.com/user/project"
#   version = "1.0.0"
#
# [[constraint]]
#   name = "github.com/user/project2"
#   branch = "dev"
#   source = "github.com/myfork/project2"
#
# [[override]]
#   name = "github.com/x/y"
#   version = "2.4.0"
#
# [prune]
#   non-go = false
#   go-tests = true
#   unused-packages = true

[[constraint]]
  name = "github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk"
  version = "v0.32.0"

[[override]]
  name = "github.com/golang/protobuf"
  version = "=1.1.0"

[[constraint]]
  name = "github.com/spf13/cobra"
  version = "~0.0.1"

[[constraint]]
  name = "github.com/spf13/viper"
  version = "~1.0.0"

[[override]]
  name = "github.com/tendermint/go-amino"
  version = "v0.14.1"

[[override]]
  name = "github.com/tendermint/iavl"
  version = "v0.12.0"

[[override]]
  name = "github.com/tendermint/tendermint"
  version = "v0.30.0-rc0"

[[override]]
  name = "golang.org/x/crypto"
  source = "https://github.com/tendermint/crypto"
  revision = "3764759f34a542a3aef74d6b02e35be7ab893bba"

[[override]]
  name = "github.com/otiai10/copy"
  revision = "7e9a647135a142c2669943d4a4d29be015ce9392"

[[override]]
  name = "github.com/btcsuite/btcd"
  revision = "ed77733ec07dfc8a513741138419b8d9d3de9d2d"

[prune]
  go-tests = true
  unused-packages = true
```

> _*NOTE*_: If you are starting from scratch in your own repo, before running `dep ensure -v` BE SURE YOU HAVE REPLACED THE IMPORT FOR `github.com/cosmos/sdk-application-tutorial` WITH THE IMPORT FOR YOUR WHOLE REPO (probably `github.com/{ .Username }/{ .Project.Repo }`). If you don't you will need to remove the `./vendor` directory (`rm -rf ./vendor`) as well as the `Gopkg.lock` files (`rm Gopkg.lock`) before running `dep ensure -v` again.

Now that this bit of house keeping is done, its time to install dep, as well as your dependencies:

```bash
make get_tools
dep ensure -v
```

## Building the app

```bash
# Update dependencies to match the constraints and overrides above
dep ensure -update -v

# Install the app into your $GOBIN
make install

# Now you should be able to run the following commands:
nsd help
nscli help
```

### Congratulations, you have finished your nameservice application! Try [running and interacting with it](./build-run.md)!
