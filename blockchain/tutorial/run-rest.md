# Run REST routes

Now that you tested your CLI queries and transactions, time to test same things in the REST server. Leave the `nsd` that you had running earlier and start by gathering your addresses:

```bash
$ nscli keys show jack --address
$ nscli keys show alice --address
```

Now its time to start the `rest-server` in another terminal window:

```bash
$ nscli rest-server --chain-id testchain --trust-node
```

Then you can construct and run the following queries:

> NOTE: Be sure to substitute your password and buyer/owner addresses for the ones listed below!

```bash
# Get the sequence and account numbers for jack to construct the below requests
$ curl -s http://localhost:1317/auth/accounts/$(nscli keys show jack -a)
